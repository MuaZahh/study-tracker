# localStorage to Firebase Migration Guide

Your localStorage data has been successfully extracted and is ready for migration to Firebase!

## 📁 Extracted Data Files

All your localStorage data has been extracted to `extracted-localStorage-data/`:

- `chemistry.json` - Chemistry subject with 5 chapters
- `math.json` - Math subject with 10 chapters (Algebra, Quadratics, etc.)
- `physics.json` - Physics subject with Kinematics, Dynamics
- `computer-science.json` - Computer Science with IGCSE content
- `dismissed-revisions.json` - 3 dismissed revision reminders
- `study-sessions-complete.json` - Study session data from July-September 2025
- `firebase-migration-data.json` - **Clean, formatted data ready for Firebase**

## 🎯 Migration Options

### Option 1: Automated Migration (Recommended)

Run the migration script that uses your existing Firebase service:

```bash
# Make sure you have Firebase credentials configured
node migrate-localStorage-data.js
```

**If you get ES Module errors:**
```bash
# Rename the file and try again
mv migrate-localStorage-data.js migrate-localStorage-data.mjs
node migrate-localStorage-data.mjs
```

### Option 2: Manual Migration

1. Open `firebase-migration-data.json`
2. Copy the entire content
3. Go to Firebase Console → Firestore Database
4. Navigate to collection: `userData`
5. Document: `default-user`
6. Update/create with the following structure:

```javascript
{
  subjects: [/* paste subjects array from firebase-migration-data.json */],
  dismissedRevisions: [/* paste dismissedRevisions array */],
  lastUpdated: /* Firebase will auto-add this */
}
```

## 📊 What Will Be Migrated

### Subjects (4 total):
- **Chemistry** (ID: 1753906226472) - 5 chapters, 1 completed
- **Math** (ID: 1753906475221) - 10 chapters (Algebraic Expressions → Integration)
- **Physics** (ID: 1753906238783) - 3 chapters (Kinematics, Dynamics, 4.1 & 4.2)
- **Computer Science** (ID: 1753906000379) - 3 chapters (IGCSE content)

### Additional Data:
- **Dismissed Revisions**: 3 revision reminders you've permanently dismissed
- **Study Sessions**: Session data structure ready for calendar integration

## 🔧 Your Current Firebase Structure

Your app uses:
- **Database**: Firestore
- **Collection**: `userData`
- **Document**: `default-user`
- **Project**: `study-tracker-56d8c`

## ✅ Post-Migration Verification

After migration, verify:

1. **Open your study tracker app**
2. **Check all 4 subjects load correctly**
3. **Verify chapter counts match:**
   - Chemistry: 5 chapters
   - Math: 10 chapters
   - Physics: 3 chapters
   - Computer Science: 3 chapters
4. **Test that dismissed revisions don't reappear**
5. **Add a new study session to test calendar functionality**

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

**Migration Script Issues:**
- Ensure Firebase credentials are in your environment
- Check internet connection
- Verify Firebase project permissions

**Manual Migration Issues:**
- Make sure you're in the correct Firebase project
- Check Firestore security rules allow writes
- Verify the document path: `userData/default-user`

**Data Verification:**
- If subjects don't load, check the browser console for errors
- Ensure the data structure matches your app's expectations
- Test with a small subset first if needed

## 📝 Data Recovery Notes

The localStorage data was recovered from LevelDB files with these limitations:
- Some study session data was fragmented due to binary storage format
- Chapter completion status was partially recoverable (Chemistry had one completed chapter)
- The data represents active usage from July-September 2025
- All subject names and structures were successfully recovered

Your study tracker was actively used with regular 7-10 minute study sessions across all subjects!
